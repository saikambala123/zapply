# Zapply

A job application autofill tool: a Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension that fills application forms in one click, remembers the answers you write, and logs every application to a tracker — backed by a Next.js + MongoDB app that deploys to Vercel.

Built as a functional equivalent of SpeedyApply, with an independent UI and its own implementation.

## Setup

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 2. Configure

Only two variables are required:

| Variable | Required | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | **yes** | — |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **yes** | — (`openssl rand -base64 48`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | **in production** | OAuth redirects, reset links and Stripe returns point at localhost |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | no | Gemini-powered scoring, drafting and resume parsing; scoring falls back to keyword overlap when no key is configured |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | no | Optional Gemini model override; defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID` | no | Upgrading marks the account Premium directly, so the flow stays testable |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | no | The Google button returns a clear error |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | no | Reset emails are logged server-side; in dev the link is returned to the browser |

For MongoDB Atlas: create a free M0 cluster, add a database user, and allow access from `0.0.0.0/0` so Vercel's functions can connect.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run seed     # optional — demo@zapply.dev / demo1234
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

### 4. Load the extension

```bash
npm run ext:build     # produces dist/chrome and dist/firefox

# For anything you actually publish, set the API base first — otherwise every
# install points at the packaging machine's own localhost:
ZAPPLY_API_BASE="https://your-app.vercel.app" npm run ext:build
```

**Chrome / Edge** — `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → `dist/chrome`
**Firefox** — `about:debugging` → **Load Temporary Add-on** → `dist/firefox/manifest.json`

Then: dashboard → **Overview → Connect the extension** → **Generate pairing code**, click the Zapply icon, enter the 6 characters, press **Connect**.

Now open any job application. It fills.

> The two builds exist because Firefox doesn't support `background.service_worker`. Shipping one manifest to both silently breaks the Firefox add-on, so `manifest.firefox.json` swaps in an event page instead.

---

## Deploying

Two artifacts, two destinations. **The extension does not deploy to Vercel** — Vercel serves the web app; the extension is distributed through the browser stores (or loaded unpacked).

### The web app → Vercel

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

Then add `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` under **Project → Settings → Environment Variables** and redeploy. `vercel.json` already sets a 30s function timeout for the AI routes.

After deploying, point the extension at your domain: open the popup, expand **Server URL**, and enter `https://your-app.vercel.app`.

For Stripe, add a webhook to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/billing/webhook` for `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed` and `customer.subscription.deleted`.

For Google sign-in, the authorised redirect URI must be exactly `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`.

### The extension → browser stores

Build with your deployed domain baked in, then upload:

```bash
ZAPPLY_API_BASE="https://your-app.vercel.app" npm run ext:build
```

Upload `dist/zapply-chrome.zip` to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole) (one-time $5 developer fee, review usually takes 1–3 days) and `dist/zapply-firefox.zip` to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) (free).

The build rewrites `DEFAULT_API` in `background.js` from that variable and fails loudly if the marker is missing, so a release can't silently ship pointing at `localhost`. Users can still override the server in the popup for local development.

## How the autofill actually works

This is the part that makes or breaks a tool like this, so it's worth explaining.

**1. Deriving the question.** A form field rarely says what it wants in one place. `deriveLabel()` collects every signal — `<label for>`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, placeholder, the wrapping `<label>`, a `<legend>`, the nearest labelled container, and finally the `name`/`id` split into words (`firstName` → `first name`) — and concatenates them so a single regex pass covers all of them.

**2. Scoring, not first-match.** Every rule in `field-map.js` carries a weight, a set of `match` regexes and a set of `deny` regexes. `deny` is what stops "First Name" from filling "Reference First Name". Earlier regexes within a rule score higher, so precise patterns beat loose ones. Highest score wins.

**3. Setting the value so the page believes it.** Assigning `el.value = x` updates the DOM but not React's internal state, so the value disappears on submit. Instead the matcher grabs the *native* setter off `HTMLInputElement.prototype` and calls it, then dispatches `input`, `change` and `blur`. Custom comboboxes (react-select, Workday) get typed into, waited on, then have their listbox option clicked. Resume uploads try three strategies, ending with a real `drop` event for drag-and-drop zones.

**4. Anything left over becomes memory.** Unmatched fields get outlined; when the user types an answer and blurs, it's captured, normalized (lowercased, punctuation and filler words stripped, tokens lightly stemmed), and synced. Next time any site asks something similar, stemmed token overlap above 0.6 reuses it. The threshold is deliberately high — submitting a wrong answer to a real employer is much worse than leaving a box empty.

### What Premium changes in that flow

With a Premium account and a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set, two extra steps run inside the same fill:

1. **Before filling** — if you keep more than one profile, the extension sends the posting to `/api/ai/score`, which ranks your profiles against it. The winner is used for the fill, and the status pill tells you which one and why (`Using "Backend roles" — 87% match`). Without an API key this falls back to keyword overlap rather than failing.
2. **After filling** — up to four open-ended questions that no rule and no saved answer covered get drafted from your own profile via `/api/ai/answer`. Drafts are outlined in violet so they read differently from filled facts, and whatever you edit before submitting is what gets saved as the reusable answer.

Both are skipped silently on the free plan, and a failure in either never blocks the fill.

### Verifying it

```bash
npm install --no-save jsdom
node scripts/test-autofill.mjs
```

Runs the real engine against a mock Greenhouse-shaped form and prints a per-field report, then checks a set of decoy fields (Reference First Name, Emergency Contact Phone, Spouse Last Name, Desired Job Title…) that must all be left alone. Current result: **27/28 filled, 0 false positives.** The single skip is "Why do you want to work at Northwind?" — a company-specific question with no close saved answer, which is correct behavior: on the free plan it's left for you, and with Premium the drafting pass writes it from your profile.

## API

All routes return `{ ok: true, data }` or `{ ok: false, error }`.

**Auth** — `POST /api/auth/register` · `POST /api/auth/login` · `POST /api/auth/logout` · `GET /api/auth/me` · `GET /api/auth/google` → `GET /api/auth/google/callback` · `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` · `POST /api/auth/reset-password` · `GET|POST /api/auth/verify-email`

**Profiles** — `GET|POST /api/profiles` · `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/profiles/[id]` · `POST /api/profiles/import`

**Applications** — `GET|POST /api/applications` · `PATCH|DELETE /api/applications/[id]` · `GET /api/applications/stats`

**Saved answers** — `GET|POST /api/responses` · `PATCH|DELETE /api/responses/[id]`

**Settings** — `GET|PATCH /api/settings`

**Extension** (bearer token) — `GET /api/extension/pair` issues a code · `POST /api/extension/pair` redeems it · `GET /api/extension/bootstrap` returns profile + settings + answers in one payload · `POST /api/extension/check` asks "have I applied here already?" · `POST /api/extension/sync` logs an application and any new answers

**AI** (Premium) — `POST /api/ai/score` · `POST /api/ai/answer` · `POST /api/ai/parse-resume`

**Billing** — `POST /api/billing/trial` · `POST /api/billing/checkout` (new subscribers) · `POST /api/billing/portal` (existing subscribers) · `POST /api/billing/webhook`

> Checkout and portal are deliberately separate. Sending a current subscriber to checkout creates a *second* subscription and bills them twice — the "Manage subscription" button must go to the portal.

**Files** — `POST|DELETE /api/resume/upload`

### How the extension authenticates

Cookies don't work for an extension acting across arbitrary origins, so pairing uses a short-lived code instead:

```
Dashboard  ──GET /api/extension/pair──▶  6-char code, 10 min TTL, stored on the user
Extension  ──POST /api/extension/pair──▶  code exchanged for a 180-day bearer JWT
Extension  ──Authorization: Bearer ...──▶  bootstrap / sync
```

The token lives in `chrome.storage.local` and only the background worker touches it — content scripts ask the worker to make calls, so credentials never enter a page's context.

---

## The AI provider

AI runs on [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) using the Gemini API free tier. Get a key from Google AI Studio, set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and redeploy.

The project uses Gemini as its only AI provider. `GEMINI_MODEL` is optional and defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`. No Groq, OpenAI-compatible, OpenRouter, xAI, or other AI credentials are required.

### Resume parsing

PDFs are extracted server-side with `unpdf`, and DOCX files with `mammoth`, before the text is sent to Gemini. The parser no longer truncates normal resumes at 24,000 characters; it preserves the complete extracted text up to a large defensive ceiling, which is far beyond typical 10+ page resumes. Gemini 2.5 Flash supports a 1M-token context window, so long resumes do not lose their later experience, education, skills, or certifications.

For scanned/image-only PDFs and image resumes, Gemini's multimodal input is used as the OCR fallback. Legacy binary `.DOC` is not converted server-side on Vercel; save it as `.DOCX` or PDF for reliable extraction.

## Security

- **Passwords** are bcrypt-hashed; sessions are HS256 JWTs in `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax` cookies.
- **Rate limiting is database-backed**, not in-memory. An in-process counter is useless on Vercel because each serverless instance has its own memory — an attacker just spreads requests across instances. Counters live in Mongo with a TTL index, so the limit is global and self-cleaning. Login is capped per-account *and* per-IP; the limiter fails open, since a database blip shouldn't lock everyone out of signing in.
- **Reset and verification tokens** are stored as SHA-256 hashes, so a leaked database dump can't be used to take over accounts. They're single-use and expire (1 hour / 24 hours).
- **Forgot-password never reveals whether an address has an account** — the response is identical either way.
- **Google OAuth** uses a `state` nonce in an `httpOnly` cookie, checked on callback. An existing email links to the current account rather than creating a duplicate.
- **The extension's bearer token lives only in the background worker.** Content scripts ask the worker to make API calls, so credentials never enter a page's JavaScript context where a hostile site could read them.

## Notes and limits

- **Resumes are stored as base64 on the profile document.** Fine up to ~4 MB, which covers a resume. For production, move `documents.dataUrl` to S3 or UploadThing and store a URL.
- **Auto Pilot is off by default** and stays that way. Filling is safe; submitting on someone's behalf is not something to turn on quietly.
- **Applications are unique per `(userId, url)`**, so re-submitting a posting updates the row rather than duplicating it. The extension also checks before filling and warns you instead of quietly applying twice.
- **Profile exports don't include documents.** A base64 resume would bloat the JSON; re-attach it after importing.
- **AI-drafted answers are outlined in violet on the page** so they read differently from filled facts — they're meant to be reviewed, and whatever you edit is what gets saved.
- **AI features degrade gracefully.** Profile scoring falls back to keyword overlap without a `GOOGLE_API_KEY`; billing falls back to a mock upgrade without Stripe keys.
- Adding a new ATS is one entry in `extension/lib/ats.js`. Most sites already work through the generic adapter, since matching is label-driven rather than selector-driven.
