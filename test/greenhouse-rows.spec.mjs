/**
 * Repeat sections are only created once one of them has been answered.
 *
 *   node test/greenhouse-rows.spec.mjs
 *
 * Reported on a Greenhouse embed: pressing Fill left the form with block after
 * block of Education, every School / Degree / Discipline reading "Select...".
 *
 * Rows were created up front, from the number of entries in the profile alone,
 * before anything had been written. Greenhouse's newer embed renders those three
 * as comboboxes whose options are fetched remotely, so none of them could be
 * driven — the rows were added, never filled, and left for the applicant to
 * delete one by one. Each empty row also cost another three fruitless dropdown
 * attempts, which is where the time went.
 *
 * Against the original code: 5 blocks from 4 Add clicks, 66s.
